# Address Book - CS 3330.

This repository is final project for the class entitled:

## Object Oriented Programming

This was done using JavaFX and Scenebuilder through Netbeans IDE.

Project description: One day I hope to work with mobile applications or a company that makes phones, tablets, etc. So I made an address book that allows the user to add their information to my contact book.

1. The address book used the following in order to meet the criteria of this assignment:
    1. The first requirement is to have classes, subclasses, and at least one abstract class or interface.
    2. My collection class
    3. Exception handling
    4. Scene switching
    5. The application saves data
    6. There is a way to access “About” information
    7. The app has a clearly defined model. See ModelUML.pdf in the folder.
